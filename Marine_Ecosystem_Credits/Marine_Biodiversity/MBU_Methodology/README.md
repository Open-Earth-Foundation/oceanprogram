# Testing methodologies to calculate modulating factors

### Calculating and comparing marine biodiversity metrics

To know about the status of our work, you can review this [Marine Biodiversity Credit Status](https://www.notion.so/openearth/Marine-Biodiversity-Credit-Status-Open-381755efad894eacb6204b78bbfc352d)

**Problem we are trying to solve:**

It is difficult to evaluate the outcome and effectiveness of marine conservation efforts because
- There exists different metrics
- There exists different local needs
- In addition, there is limited data

Because all these problems exists, one solution we are proposing is the Marine Biodiversity Unit (MBU). 

**The goal of the MBU is:**

- quantify marine conservation efforts
- create a unit to evaluate on a global scale

For that, we propose “adjusted squares” kilometers 

Where, the ***base unit*** could be:

1 credit = 1 km2 of efforts / 1 year

Considering diferrent modulating factors, such as:
- Normalized Biodiversity Score
- Species richness
- Species Distribution Area
- Endemism
- Habitats' Survey
- Vulnerability
- Proxy Specis Functional Area

This series of notebooks aims to calculate different marine biodiversity indices align with the modulating factors, such as:
- WEGE
- STAR
- Shannon Index
- Simpson Index
- (...)

for a few areas around Cocos Island, Costa Rica:
- AMMB, or Área Marina de Manejo del Bicentenario (marine protected area that got extended for the bicentennial)
- PNIC, or Parque National de Isla del Coco (Cocos Island national park)
- ACMC, or Area de Conservación Marina Coco (AMMB + PNIC)([ACMC](https://www.sinac.go.cr/ES/ac/acmic/Paginas/default.aspx))

Happy to know about your ideas about this project and how we can improve our work.
