<h1> Calculating and comparing marine biodiversity metrics </h1>

**Problem we are trying to solve:**

It is difficult to evaluate the outcome and effectiveness of marine conservation efforts because
- There exists different metrics
- There exists different local needs
- In addition, there is limited data

Because all these problems exists, one solution we are proposing is the Marine Biodiversity Unit (MBU). 

**The goal of the MBU is:**

- quantify marine conservation efforts
- create a unit to evaluate on a global scale

For that, we propose “adjusted squares” kilometers 

Where, the ***base unit*** could be:

1 credit = 1 km2 of efforts / 1 year

Considering diferrent modulating factors, such as:
- Normalized Biodiversity Score
- Species richness
- Species Distribution Area
- Endemism
- Vulnerability
- Habitats' Survey
- Proxy Specis Functional Area

This series of notebooks aims to calculate different marine biodiversity indices align with the modulating factors, such as:
- WEGE
- STAR
- Shannon Index
- Simpson Index
- (...)

for a few areas around Cocos Island, Costa Rica:
- AMMB, or Área Marina de Manejo del Bicentenario (marine protected area that got extended for the bicentennial)
- PNIC, or Parque National de Isla del Coco (Cocos Island national park)
- ACMC, or Area de Conservación Marina Coco (AMMB + PNIC)([ACMC](https://www.sinac.go.cr/ES/ac/acmic/Paginas/default.aspx))

We will later extend to the Eastern Tropical Pacific. 
The main data source that we use is UICN.
