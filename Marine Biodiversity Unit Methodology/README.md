<h1> Calculating and comparing marine biodiversity metrics for ACMC </h1>

This series of notebooks aims to calculate different marine biodiversity indices, such as:
- WEGE
- STAR
- etc

for a few areas around Cocos Island, Costa Rica:
- AMMB, or Área Marina de Manejo del Bicentenario (marine protected area that got extended for the bicentennial)
- PNIC, or Parque National de Isla del Coco (Cocos Island national park)
- ACMC, or Area de Conservación Marina Coco (AMMB + PNIC)

We will later extend to the Eastern Tropical Pacific. The data source that we use is UICN.

We are considering different modulating factors:

- Normalized Biodiversity Score
- Species richness
- Species Distribution Area
- Endemism
- Vulnerability
- Habitats' Survey
- Proxy Specis Functional Area
