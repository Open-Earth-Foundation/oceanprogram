Hi Margaux and Louisa,

Attached here is the WEGE on mammals in Mozambique. I used polygons, but one can also use georeferenced points. 
The link for the polygons can be found here: you will have to download the whole folder because the shapefile requires the accessory files to work.

The decision on whether it is better to use polygons or points will have to do with the particular goal in mind. Other considerations such as the resolution and the taxonomic groups must also be in accordance with which taxa you want to use - some groups are more well known than others and are better mapped. Other taxa may have quite wide ranges, and the WEGE index must be carefully tweaked to only include the relevant portions of the range, for example - breeding sites are more relevant than if the species just passes by a certain area.

Let me know what you think, 
Btw, I also offer consultancy services, so in the case that your company prefers to hire someone to produce the heat maps we can discuss it further :),

Hope this helps,

Best,
Harith
