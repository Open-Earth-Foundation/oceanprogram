# Ocean Program

Repository for the [Ocean Program](https://www.openearth.org/projects/ocean-program) at the Open Earth Foundation.

In February 2022, the Open Earth Foundation launched its Ocean Program to build the digital architecture needed to conserve 30% of the global ocean by 2030, following the 30 by 30 (30x30) initiative [Dinerstein et al, 2019; Kubiak, 2020], and to help solve the global environmental problems that affect it. 
A key focus of the program is marine conservation and, specifically, the conservation of marine biodiversity.

## Uses
This series of notebooks aims to calculate different marine biodiversity indices, such as:
- WEGE: Weighted Endemism including Global Endangerment index
- STAR: Species Threat Abatement and Recovery
- other Marine Biodiversity Units

## Data needed for this project

The data was output by `ACMC_IUCN_step1_curatedata.ipynb` and can be found under [Cocos_UICNmarinespecies](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1waEAtfQwErhBKH3GkTHZXIlbadzH3HYu?usp=sharing).

It has also been gathered on our [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yElWSaK0tWvlyDvjNUSpqnnwEJGMGdPX?usp=sharing) under a temporary folder that accompagnies the GitHub repository: 

`Ocean Program > data > to download for gh > ACMC_IUCN_data`
